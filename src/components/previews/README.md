## What's in this directory?
Previews give a glimpse at some content, without displaying the whole component. For example, [YSS' event page](https://www.yss.org/events/) contains **previews** of their events, with a title and short description. Clicking `Read More` redirects the page to the full view of the component. For this site, these full views are found in `components/views`.
